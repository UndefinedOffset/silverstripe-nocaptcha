Nocaptcha
=================

Adds a "spam protection" field to SilverStripe userforms using Google's
[reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha) service.

## Requirements
* SilverStripe 4.x
* [SilverStripe Spam Protection
  3.x](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-spamprotection/)
* PHP CURL

## Installation
```
composer require undefinedoffset/silverstripe-nocaptcha
```

After installing the module via composer or manual install you must set the spam
protector to NocaptchaProtector, this needs to be set in your site's config file
normally this is mysite/\_config/config.yml.
```yml
SilverStripe\SpamProtection\Extension\FormSpamProtectionExtension:
    default_spam_protector: UndefinedOffset\NoCaptcha\Forms\NocaptchaProtector
```

Finally, add the "spam protection" field to your form by calling
``enableSpamProtection()`` on the form object.
```php
$form->enableSpamProtection();
```

## Configuration
There are multiple configuration options for the field, you must set the
site_key and the secret_key which you can get from the [reCAPTCHA
page](https://www.google.com/recaptcha). These configuration options must be
added to your site's yaml config typically this is mysite/\_config/config.yml.
```yml
UndefinedOffset\NoCaptcha\Forms\NocaptchaField:
    site_key: "YOUR_SITE_KEY" #Your site key (required)
    secret_key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" #Your secret key (required)
    recaptcha_version: 2 # 2 or 3
    minimum_score: 0.2 # minimum spam score to achieve. Any less is blocked
    verify_ssl: true #Allows you to disable php-curl's SSL peer verification by setting this to false (optional, defaults to true)
    default_theme: "light" #Default theme color (optional, light or dark, defaults to light)
    default_type: "image" #Default captcha type (optional, image or audio, defaults to image)
    default_size: "normal" #Default size (optional, normal, compact or invisible, defaults to normal)
    default_badge: "bottomright" #Default badge position (bottomright, bottomleft or inline, defaults to bottomright)
    proxy_server: "" #Your proxy server address (optional)
    proxy_port: "" #Your proxy server address port (optional)
    proxy_auth: "" #Your proxy server authentication information (optional)

# The following options can also be specified through Environment variables with Injector config
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  UndefinedOffset\NoCaptcha\Forms\NocaptchaField:
    properties:
      SiteKey: '`SS_NOCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`'
      SecretKey: '`SS_NOCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`'
      ProxyServer: '`SS_OUTBOUND_PROXY`'
      ProxyPort: '`SS_OUTBOUND_PROXY_PORT`'
      ProxyAuth: '`SS_OUTBOUND_PROXY_AUTH`'
```

## Adding field labels

If you want to add a field label or help text to the Captcha field you can do so
like this:

```php
$form->enableSpamProtection()
    ->fields()->fieldByName('Captcha')
    ->setTitle("Spam protection")
    ->setDescription("Please tick the box to prove you're a human and help us stop spam.");
```

### Commenting Module
When your using the
[silverstripe/comments](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-comments)
module you must add the following (per their documentation) to your \_config.php
in order to use nocaptcha/spamprotection on comment forms.

```php
CommentingController::add_extension('CommentSpamProtection');
```

## Retrieving the Verify Response

If you wish to manually retrieve the Site Verify response in you form action use
the `getVerifyResponse()` method

```php
function doSubmit($data, $form) {
    $captchaResponse = $form->Fields()->fieldByName('Captcha')->getVerifyResponse();

    // $captchaResponse = array (size=5) [
    //  'success' => boolean true
    //  'challenge_ts' => string '2020-09-08T20:48:34Z' (length=20)
    //  'hostname' => string 'localhost' (length=9)
    //  'score' => float 0.9
    //  'action' => string 'submit' (length=6)
    // ];
}
```

## ReCAPTCHA v3

ReCAPTCHA v3 is different to v2, users won't be presented with a "Are you a
robot?" checkbox, instead user actions are returned a spam score 0.0 to 1.0 when
they submit the form. Out of the box, this module will block any submission with
a spam score of <= 0.4 but this can be tailored either site-wide using the
Config API

```yml
UndefinedOffset\NoCaptcha\Forms\NocaptchaField:
  minimum_score: 0.2
```

Or on a per form basis:

```php
$captchaField = $form->Fields()->fieldByName('Captcha')-
$captchaField->setMinimumScore(0.2);
```

For more information about version 3, including how to implement custom actions
